# WeatherApp :sun_behind_small_cloud:

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.1.

## The Deets

Had a bit of time on my hands and wanted to keep my coding sharp. 
Using Angular, Bootstrap and the APIXU API. 

Found a super helpful tutorial to guide the process and increase familiarity with the framework.  First time touching Angular, and took roughly 3 hours to complete (30 min nap included)

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
